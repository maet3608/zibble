Files with path but on different drives cause conflict
in zip file, eg.
c:/data/test.dat
d:/data/test.dat
=> how to handle that
=> is that is handled, files could also be stored without
   path only by name



Include ALWAYS requires pattern for folder even when
only files in source folder are wanted, eg.
PROJECT
  NAME ZuluPad
  FROM c:/Maet/Software/ZuluPadPro
  TO {dest}/zulu.zip
  INCLUDE /*, *.zulu    #/.* is needed!
=> change or update docu

Docu: 
- Mention that patterns/filenames are case sensitive!
- FAQ: list of error messages and meanings
  - "Zip file must have at least one entry"
  - File not fund
  - case sensitve patterns/filenames
  - parsing errors of projects file. How does error looks like  

set thread priority to low

ERROR should not stop archiving of other projects

run individual projects from a projects file


conditional vars
VAR {dest} IF user.name = stefan THEN c:/stefan/backup ELSE c:/user
